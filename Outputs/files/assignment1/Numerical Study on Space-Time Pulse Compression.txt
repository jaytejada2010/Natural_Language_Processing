A numerical study of the properties of Gaussian pulses propagating in planar waveguide under the combined effect of positive Kerr-type nonlinearity, diffraction in planar waveguides and anomalous or normal dispersion, is presented. It is demonstrated how the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction, the strength of nonlinearity and the initial spatial and temporal pulse chirps effect on the parameters of pulse compression, such as the maximal compression factor and the distance to the point of maximal compression.
