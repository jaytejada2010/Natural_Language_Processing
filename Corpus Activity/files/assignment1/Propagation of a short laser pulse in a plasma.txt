The propagation of an electromagnetic pulse in a plasma is studied for pulse durations that are comparable to the plasma period. When the carrier frequency of the incident pulse is much higher than the plasma frequency, the pulse propagates without distortion at its group speed. When the carrier frequency is comparable to the plasma frequency, the pulse is distorted and leaves behind it an electromagnetic wake.
